🎂 HAPPY BIRTHDAY CODE PROJECT 🎂
Created by: Irfan Dev Journey

THANK YOU for downloading! 
Here is how to use this code:

1. HOW TO RUN:
   - Simply double-click "index.html" and it will open in your browser.

2. HOW TO CHANGE THE NAME:
   - Right-click "index.html" and select "Open with Notepad" (or VS Code).
   - Scroll to the bottom and find "Happy Birthday My Love!".
   - Change "My Love" to any name you want!

3. HOW TO VIEW THE CAKE:
   - Extract this ZIP folder.
   - Right-click 'index.html' and open with Chrome or Safari.

4. HOW TO SEND ON WHATSAPP (LIKE THE VIDEO):
   - To get the "Cake Icon" and a clickable link in WhatsApp, you must HOST this code online.
   - If you just send the file, it will look like a document icon.
   - To make it a real link (e.g., www.hername.com), use HOSTINGER.
